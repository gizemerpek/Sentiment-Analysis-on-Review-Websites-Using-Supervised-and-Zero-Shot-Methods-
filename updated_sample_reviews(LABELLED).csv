Emily Charlotte Reynolds;January 08, 2024;i have been on zoe for 4 months now and will not be resubscribing for someone that has never considered how what they eat affects their body then this is for you however if like myself you have done a lot of research on combining foods and their effects on your blood sugar etc then you will get minimal benefit from this programme if this sounds like you you would be better getting a 2 week free trial of a continuous glucose monitor yourself and testing out food combinations;3;Negative

Benjamin Leo Lerner;August 11, 2021;the therapist they provided seemed underqualified didnt really connect with her thats not really a knock on the system itself what was bad about cerebral the company was that they make it impossible to cancel there is no option to do so on the main website you need to send a request to a special email which takes a while to respond then they make you fill out a cancellation form i promptly filled it outandthey still charged me on the next cycle i disputed the charge and told cerebral that id submitted my cancellation form they said it was still processing so i waited forgot about itand then sure enough they charged me again what a scam;1;Negative

Laney;September 12, 2021;my package says it was delivered but it isnt here ;2;Negative
Alison;December 10, 2023;the approach and the information are based on science not on fads or trying to sell you something the  ability to see how my body reacted to different foods combinations or time of day was fascinating and i learnt a lot although it revealed that i didnt do well with bread and pasta which i love i was able to adapt my diet relatively easily and now i have these as treats rather than staples  and enjoy them more it also showed that it is best to have a varied diet rather than eat the same things all the time and i have become much more adventurous in mixing things in salads stews stir fries etc what is most impressive is that i dont feel the need to snack  and that i have lost weight around my middle without trying it has really changed my approach to food and diet the one thing that could be improved is the chat function  my questions are always answered eventually but perhaps rephrase how you describe it so as not to suggest it is a live chat which is probably what most people are used to  even if they are from bots;5;Positive

Dinuli Senaratne;July 12, 2024;i have been working with a nutritionist called harriet she is amazing she has been flexible to have telephone calls around my schedule and very personcentred in terms of my food preferences she has sent me a list of recipes which is around my food preference and to overcome challenges in my food preparation she has also sent me many educational resources that i previously was not aware of i am also now aware of how much protein and fibre i should be having daily to maintain a balanced diet she is prompt in her delivery and communication she checks in on me when i have gone quiet to ensure that i am still on track with my journey and has helped me to get back on track when i have struggled she also works in a compassionate approach where the change is gradual so it doesnt feel overwhelming as well as all the amazing tasty recipes and all the other useful videos and articles etc having a nutritionist by my side to guide me is my favourite thing about zoe i would highly recommend zoe to anyone very worth the money;5;Positive

Consumer;November 28, 2024;i have been on the zoe journey since kate spring and have gradually changed my diet with encouragement every step of the way i feel full all the time i dont have blood sugar drops anymore and i have lost just over a stone in weight i wish this had been discovered years ago the advice is invaluable and the app excellent especially for using when shopping as it has a barcode checker to find how good that particular food is for you as an individual ive had a retest of my gut microbe and the good bacteria has increased dramatically i feel more energetic no brain fog and much healthier imogen has been recently been  helping me in the research community hub and has been invaluable its an amazing journey and i hope it can be made more widely available to people on a lower income i didnt have any hesitation in paying for the app as it cost no more than going to slimming world or weight watchers per month but the initial tests cost  would be difficult for many people although when you see the box of equipment you know why it cost that much i highly recommend zoe for optimum health;5;Positive
Annie warwick;November 16, 2023;i have completed my zoe testing and gained some really useful results however the customer service is terrible unfortunately they promise in app support  but they take literally days to reply this was frustrating enough during the testing period but it has continued they advertise degree level nutritionists to answer queries but my question re scores has been ignored although asked 2 days ago are there not enough staff for the amount of people they are taking expensive memberships from there has also been a billing error where i have been charged membership twice thats 14396 extra i have also emailed zoe with no reply its not much good paying for the testing if help to understand it is not available what a shame that i have to leave a bad review in an attempt to get someone to answer;1;Negative

S. Gauntlett;March 27, 2024;i joined zoe to learn how to eat healthier so that i can be fit  full of energy to run around after my grandchild it is a challenge changing your eating habits  learning about how to combine foods for better gut health the program is very informative with lessons that gradually introduce you to new ideas  teach you what is personally best for you however i had lots of questions  i found that i really didnt like the taste of tofu although it was good for me  didnt know how to use pearl barley  bulgar wheat in a tasty interesting way so lucy came to my rescue zoe provides an excellent chatmessage support forum where you can ask questions  one of their dieticians will answer your questions lucy was the dietician who supported me she gave me loads of tips  ideas for recipes with pearl barley  bulgar wheat she answered all my questions  gave me alternatives to eat instead of tofu she even helped me when i was finding it difficult to make my healthy meals  cook something different for my husband she gave me meal suggestions with a healthy twist that we could both enjoy eating together joining zoe really feels like being part of a community they support you every step of the way all you have to do is stick at it  ask for help when you need it;5;Positive
Kerrijmb;May 21, 2023;i loved this site in the beginning but the quality has really gone down in the last few months for some of the services you are now required to pay a 49 monthly fee used to be 35 they promise they will work with your insurance to get medications approved but they cant doctor response times vary dramatically more than once they have forgotten to actually call in the medications making the wait time even longer its just not worth paying for anymore when i there are other similar apps that are fully covered by my insurance;2;Negative
J Lanc;February 15, 2024;twelve months on feeling a lot more healthier sleeping better with more energy throughout the day i seem more resistant to colds and other infectionsit does take commitment logging meals and following advice but its worthwhile if you want to improve and maintain your health dont feel confident to go it alone yet so subscribed for another year the science seems to be continually developing in this area;5;Positive

Panda;April 02, 2024;so i made a bad late night mistake of signing up without properly researching so the waste of money is on me  my review is based on the content of this app and the customer service  on the content im only two days in so perhaps more features get unlocked as you go but so far its sole offering is daily lessons which defined procrastination and perfectionism poorly and very obviously asked me to define my mood by selecting one of 6 options access to focus tools which is just 6 relaxing sounds oceans white noise etc given me access to an area to write notes  access to some poor quizzes which frankly just describe some symptoms of anxietydepression and then gives you a score and a couple of pointers which arent that helpful or insightful google would do a better jobnote they lock the lessons to one a day so you cant move forward at a quicker pace or find one that may be helpful to you now  the first two lessons added zero value to me as so simplisticthat is honestly it not exactly ground breaking stuff ridiculously expensive for what it is  perhaps this is a tool designed for kids as thats the level its pitched atso on customer service i was so completely underwhelmed i reach out to customer service to ask if i could cancel because the app was so underwhelming they responded by saying sorry you quit not quite what i was doing nor the languageresponse youd expect from a business touting its know how on productivity and said that they had cancelled my accountnot sure if language challenges or just poor customer service but checked again and gave them an opportunity to do something before posting a review but they rather another poor review agree with all the feedback on transparency they obviously cant demofree trial the app as no one would sign upunless you are 612yo suggest not using this app;1;Negative

Wharfgirl;September 19, 2023;the only drawback for me was not being technically confident enough to follows the challenges i lost a day of tests because of this but it was fascinating to see how little refined flour and sugar it took to make my blood sugar soar then crash one quarter of one ham sandwich  one yogurt that hd fruit and sugar in  i knew these things but theres a difference between having read about it and seeing it happening hour by hour inside your own body the next food revolution has to be about inventing a breadless alternative to the sandwich;4;Positive

Robert Boehm;August 31, 2023;after joining and looking at their platform more closely i decided to request a cancellation i emailed headway and received no response i sent 4 emails referencing the first request to cancel and today received an email one month later stating theyre not refunding my fee because it was discounted despite me never going into the app after the first day very poor customer service and poor business sense while grabbing the money buyer beware thanks for teaching me a lesson headway interesting that youre attempting to help people be better and more educated and this is the position you takeheadway did reconsider and offer a refund therefore im changing my rating to 3 stars as i still had the same experience until achieving the desired outcome;3;Neutral

Tracy Pinkham;October 13, 2023;i have been taking part in the zoe programme for about 2 months now  to start the tests and results were very interesting and made me look more closely at what i was eating  from the lessons and the monitoring i have radically changed what i eat and when i eat it and in the last few weeks i have started to notice a difference in my body and how i feel  it has been a slow change but nevertheless it is a change  i am less bloated and crave sugar less i have also lost weight for the first time in years and managed to keep it off even after two holidays  i love the food and lessons but do find it hard to keep adding my foods each day although it is necessary to get the weekly feedback and ensure my scores are kept high if i have a criticism it is that the weekly feedback tells you were you are going wrong but does not give personalised feedback on what you have eaten that has caused the low scores overall i love the programme and am learning so much about how to eat to make my body healthier for the future without restricting myself;5;Positive
Linda Shahin;May 28, 2020;i have worked with various birth control companies in the past such as simple health the pill club and nurx ive had glowing experiences i heard of hello alpha and i wanted to see what it was about i recently checked out the website and filled in my info like i have with the other birth control companies however their site seemed to obviously be different when i was looking through options and filling out the account info i got a message and realized the site sent a request for birth control before the healthcare provider could consult with me about any kind of birth control i informed her of the mistake and asked her to immediately withdrawal my request as i did not want to be unnecessarily charged for services i didnt want or need she immediately got back to me and said that everything would be handled that was the 22nd i then went and deleted my credit card information off the site and tried to also delete my account as i have never had an experience like that through the other companies i used and i wasnt feeling great about it i then get an alert on the 23 after i got confirmation that my request had been cancelled from my bank saying that i was charged 10 i reached out to them because that clearly had to be a mistake i didnt even consult with the healthcare provider i was told that i could not be refunded and to think of it like a onetime doctors visit i understand the sentiment but like i said i didnt actually talk to the provider about anything with other companies ive used you actually talk about what youre looking for what you arent side effects your previous birth control preferences then decide on the right choice for you then everything is laid out for you and you can confirm your order after all the information including cost is mentioned i have used many of these sites i am always diligent with looking at everything i did not see anything that said i would be charged 10 or to process my order i have talked to the company and they maintain that it is there and when i filled out that information with those questions by submitting it i accepted the cost they also maintain that the onetime fee was there sorry but i dont think i wouldve missed that if i did then it must have been well hidden even if i did and it was in finer printer or an oversight i let them know immediately of the mistake and asked for a refund i did not order anything from their company wouldnt the right thing to do be to simply refund me back i didnt think it would be such a difficult task to reach out and let them know an error happened and if it could be fixed instead it seems clear that wont happen from talking to them online to over the phone it was way too hard to reach a resolution if i had actually used the services or had the birth control shipped then i could understand but this all seems very unsettling to be charged all because i wanted to explore a new birth control site furthermore on the 22nd i deleted my payment information i refreshed the page to double check and it was gone somehow though it was saved then on the 23rd the day after i was charged that sounds very suspicious the agent i talked to said i dont have to worry about any future payments because it was all taken care of and then when i went to check my payment options the credit card was back up there theres no way i can trust their company to be my potential birth control provider in the future i have never had anything like this happen with any of the popular birth control companies ive worked with i urge you to use any of the companies ive listed theyre great whenever ive had any problems with anything from shipping to charges they have quickly and happily solved the issues if this was any of them i wouldve had a refund the same day no questions asked do yourself a favor go with the other companies i mentioned because i definitely wouldnt recommend this one;1;Negative

K.;October 07, 2021;they definitely delete the bad reviews you can take a lot of time to write a detailed history about what is going on but they have a ton of patients and little time so really theyre just sending you automated recommendations for the answers you fill out on a survey i have a complicated infection and saw a physician who began treating me but it was costly and took a lot of time they clearly just pressed reviewed or clicked a box and didnt read the detailed information i provided about why my infection didnt respond to prior treatment so that i could receive a customized treatment to be realistic they cant offer customized care with such a high volume and i understand a appreciate that but i wish this was made clear i even sent a message about a symptom and my answers from the provider were obviously just automated responses and werent at all specific to me for example it says to take a test that ive already taken and clearly stated is negative im positive they will delete this review but hope people are aware before spending 40 that you will not be getting customized care if you have insurance and are able it might be more worthwhile to spend a similar amount on a copay for a telehealth visit with a provider who actually cares about your symptoms history and the context of your case;1;Negative
B Walton;July 08, 2024;took the plunge with zoe and thus far have been thrilled its still early days but i have already got to know how my body reacts to food and how to mange those reactions what also helps is the excellent service provided by the likes of sarah reid through the app all questions answered with warmth and professionalism a great experience and still so much more to learn;5;Positive

Shieleen Gregorio;August 21, 2024;i started zoe for about six weeks now and i am feeling fantastic zoe has been a sure way so far in monitoring my food intake and has helped me to make major lifestyle changes zoe is an individualized based program that measured my blood glucose microbiome and blood fat levels which is assessed in the beginning of the program through a tester kit with the results i was given and continued guidance through the zoe app i am confident in the zoe program as it is based on evidence based research and i also work in the health field and know how reasearch plays an important role to lifestyle change and health i appreciate the predicted scored detail on the foods i plan to eat daily which can be monitored just by scanning in anticipated food in the zoe app it has helped me a lot in knowing the value of the food i plan to eat zoe was recommended to me by a nurse practitioner friend of mine and i mainly started it because i wanted to start on a program that was sustainable i knew that changing my lifestyle through diet exercise and managing my microbiome was important to maintaining health i also appreciate all the information on health from zoe on youtube zoe is highly recommended because it provides me with individualized results;5;Positive
Laci Buller;December 03, 2021;ironic youre forced to concede this to cancel when this service had left me out of meds and no refills sent in time that is a cruel thing to do to people its cruel to make them ask for medication every month even though it shows they have refills on their med it is cruel to get someone close to a therapeutic dose of medication for their mental illness detox for 23 or moredays start back on lower dose get back to therapeutic levels and then run them out again if this were insulin or amlodipine this company would lose their license to practice now i have to rush to find a provider to give me medication quickly because this service does not provide you a prescription if you cancel even if you have already paid for the month these arent drugs to get high these are medication that people need to function someone yall do this to is going to end up hurting themselves shame on you its terrible you are taking advantage of people thanks for offering me 30 off to stay;1;Negative

Marie;July 30, 2024;i really like the test kit and although test day is time intensive i was excited to think that my results would be insightful and personal to me i really enjoyed the blood sugar monitoring for that 14 days and was amazed at how often my blood sugar dropped below 4 there was no comment on this in my results the results arrived promptly and i found the initial process very efficient however i was really disappointed in the results report it was not individualised and felt like very generic advice that you get across any diet reduce processed food increase natural plant based products reduce eating window i find the 30 plant based varieties over the week very hard to do even though i eat lots of salads and vegetables it is still not enough adding seeds and fruits helps but then i am eating way more calories than i normally would hence in the first three weeks i have gained weight and not lost any i have also found myself with tummy aches and loose stools frequently from all the plant based foodsi have been working on it for a couple of weeks now and just find the app and food scoring frustrating and complicated you can not work it out without the app so are tied into paying the subscription for ever and need your phone with you everywhere you go if eating out i cant see how that is not a marketing con really surely a group of people who have dedicated their work to improving peoples health and learning should have designed a system that the average person can work out and sustain it without continued costs from needing to use the appthe lessons in the app are great if you are new to dieting and nutrition advice they are explained well and set out in bitesize chunks but as someone who has invested over and over again in the latest weight management programme i didnt find any of the lessons contained anything new for me same advice as is available on any decent google search i feel like this was really a waste of money and just another diet industry abuse of a desperate person looking for the answer to their weight problemi signed up for 12 months as was committed to working with this for long term but 3 weeks in and i feel frustrated disappointed and let down i am keen to cancel but cant even see in the app how to do that and from the reviews i see that most people say they dont get any money back anyway i dont know if i can cancel the subscription per month but my next steps is to try;3;Negative
Cyclopath;September 30, 2023;zoe has very slick advertising but sadly my customer experience was poor its an expensive programme and for 300 i was expecting a much more personalised service their presentation of information is so incredibly patronising it makes me wonder who its actually aimed at plus theres nothing there that you couldnt get for free from their podcasts or other sources as the science such as it is appears to be publicly available i think the fact that theyve asked me to review their business before i have even had a chance to see my testing results is not a good sign and so far i think its fair to say that it has hindered my dietary progression as much as its helped specifically by having me do a bunch of dietary challenges which are easily achieved if you have access to a greengrocer and the cash to spare;1;Negative

Samantha Kuehler;July 14, 2024;this app is helping me to conquer the sources of my complex ptsd in the 2 weeks since i started using this app my stress and anxiety levels have dropped significantly im learning to analyze and properly handle the memories that trigger my fight or flight reflex without real danger that requires action this app is working handinhand with the things my therapist is giving me to work on it is absolutely possible to tame your demons and this app is a great tool to help with that process;5;Positive
Annette Bray;December 15, 2023;firstly i have to say tgat 6 weeks in i have loved every part of the process  from testing results and analysis to dietary advice recipes articles etc all my online chats have been very supportive and positive that was until i realised id been charged 29999 fir the testing kit and then another 299 for my annual membership i have queried this i obviously somehow missed that there would be 2 charges incurred but the original system seems bizarre  you cant have the testing without purchasing a membership package and the membership makes little sense without the testing so why price them separately only once you have joined do you receive any confirmation of the 2 fees but i didnt pickup on that and i was already committed ive found the responses fairly abrupt  basically youve seen the tcs so tough i have gneen offered a reduced membership ie one month or 4 months but although i already have a pretty good diet i feel this requires a longer term commitment to really make a permanent lifestyle change and im already invested so although i have been such a strong advocate of all things zoe this relationship has been tainted the programmes pricing seems deliberately ambiguous not what i expected from tim spector and his team  thoroughly disappointing;2;Negative

Meredith;March 13, 2022;overall in the end i am receiving the treatment i was looking for however there was some lack of communication and miscommunication over the first 2 months im hopeful this will be improved moving forward for example i was told that a prior authorization would be completed i then learned the medication was not approved however it took days of back and forth to determine the next step from the time i started with alpha it took 6 weeks 1226 to 21 to receive the medication additionally a different provider replied at one point and offered a second medication to help with side effects when the regular provider responded she said she does not prescribe that medication yet again more miscommunication i hope moving forward this will continue to meet my needs;3;Negative
Jessica King;July 22, 2022;after i lost my husband to a tragic accident i found myself to be really depressed and anxious cerebral has really helped me to manage needed medication and talk through and set goals in my grief i have had a great experience with all of the team its easy to use the prescribers and care team have very flexible hours which is important being a single mom;5;Positive

Aurthur pint;November 26, 2023;zoe is groundbreaking concept and whats more from my 1 year experience it works  you have to give it a little time but it works and is easy to stick to once you get in the flowit is not cheap as others have said but you dont have to subscribe for a long period if you dont want to  the program allows you to learn about your personal biology and response to food etc  i have benefited in multiple ways already and have learned a lot that i am carrying forward  i am sufficiently impressed that i have continued subscribing for now as zoe is evolving and tweaking and listeningzoe programme unlike many narrow fad diets is based on broad ranging and solid scientific findings and is not in it to make money as the prime directive the idea is to find a way of improving all our health through proactive easy and mostly tasty adjustments to diet and lifestyle rather than dealing with potentially expensive and unpleasant disease treatments later on  the cost i understand comes from the fact that you are in effect getting individual program tailored to your own biology  in comparison to the cost of a trip to the dentist it really isnt that bad  whats more its findings have been been proven recently through a randomised trial  i believe this is a global first for any diet zoe requires an open and receptive mind set because it differs from the more usual approach  we must take responsibility for our own health not the nhs and i feel that zoe has provided the largest most holistic and effective tool set i have ever encounteredgood bugs are good  zoe will help you support them and help you kick out the bad ones;5;Positive
David Stern;February 02, 2023;great resource i was having emotional problems so i took the online test and found out i have bipolar disorder and moderate depression i signed up for therapy and meds they gave me a price break on the first month and even at full price is cheaper than therapy and a prescriber out of cerebral i highly recommend cerebral;5;Positive

Kelly;November 02, 2024;i like the quick workouts;4;Positive
P G Jones;February 08, 2024;zoe is entirely dependant upon the app which does not always work the way it should which meant that at times it was frustrating and i did not always get out of it what i should the lessons are very simple and  maybe a little patronising but i did learn a little  inputting your food is utterly dreadful and after a couple of weeks i simply couldnt do it anymore  ironically for a system that encourages the eating of real food rather than processed it makes only the process of adding premade food easy otherwise the searching for and inputting of each ingredient became onerous  this plan is excellent and it will help most but it is mainly common sense and like most good ideas it is simple and does not require months of learning  i was disappointed with the level of information i gained from the tests and overall i felt that it was expensive for what i received  in hindsight having listened to the podcasts i dont feel i gained much more by subscribing  in short great advice annoying app;3;Negative
Angela;September 23, 2024;good assistance helped me with my issue and settled it accordingly hence had a minor misunderstanding but was solved carefully;4;Positive
Jane;February 02, 2024;great principle but expensive both in signing up and in the products you need to eat  i feel its really only available for those who can afford to change although im sure the zoe people would hotly dispute this  whilst i have followed the teachings im finding it very hard to live by an app having to be on my phone all the time  would appreciate more printed or computer accessible materialsits not a bad system it just lives too much in an instagram world to be inclusive and accessible for all  if you can afford it and have the money to overall your food cupboards give it a try;3;Negative

Jenny Jackson;May 14, 2024;zoe has brought back to me a joy of eating a variety of tasty meals to enhance my microbiome and my taste buds once my results had been analysed and i understood these were unique to me i was introduced to holly a nutritionist who guided me with suggestions nothing was too much trouble  as i found with other zoe staff when i had any questions i would recommend zoe to help anyone who wants to eat healthier;4;Positive
Bernadette Hughes;January 28, 2024;joined the programme last summer and had a gut microbiome score of 83100 excellent my other results werent so good but i was reassured by the gut score zoe contacted me a few days ago to say that my microbiome score had been updated the original score was based upon 15 good and 15 bad bacteria and the new score was based upon newly discovered bacteria now 50 good and 50 bad bacteria i excitedly opened my new results to see that my new score had decreased to 37100 poor consequently have lost much confidence in the whole program they justify this widely divergent result on the basis of scientific advancement however it has made me query the whole concept and especially the point of the original test i feel that i have  been led up the garden path and paid for the privilege wonder if anyone else has had a similar experience;3;Negative

Alan Impey;July 30, 2024;i initially experienced particularly frustrating problems with the app when the kit arrived the app refused to recognize the kit as mine and the chat feature hung when i tried to contact the support team  after responding to an email from zoe wanting to know why i hadnt started to use the kit i received great help from james in resolving these issues as he  steered me towards a recently updated version of the app i can now look forward to starting the course;5;Positive

Julie;January 13, 2024;zoe is a revolutionary personalised evidence based programme which has not only changed what i eat but my way of life i was already pretty committed to healthy eating and wasnt sure how much i would benefit from zoe but i was wrong i feel better my food bills are lower and after only a few weeks i have learned so much about my biology research and nutritionbut i have barely scratched the surface zoe is not a diet course not about losing weight but a personal nutrition programme i am eating better and never feel hungry no food is off limits because the whole point of zoe or so it seems to me is to help me to make choices which are informed by up to date world class research zoe is about taking better care of yourself and your family by eating delicious food all the time i thought it was a bit expensive and this put me off applying for a while but now i think its a bargain;5;Positive

Bailey Kent;September 01, 2022;i was a cerebral patient for 10 monthsat first they had technical issues and didnt fulfill my prescription  leaving me without medication for almost 60 daysafter that was fixed the app had ongoing technical issues and i was unable to utilize the scheduling feature for 6 months to scheduled with my counselor not once during that lapse in appointments did my care coordinator or counselor reach out to see if everything was ok   i had to realize the error on my own and contact themduring this time i had a significant increase in external stressors and a corresponding decrease to my functioning   i explained this to my medical provider and she did switch my medication   even during this transition my counselor or care coordinator never checked in after my first two quarterly assessments that functionality in the app also stopped working    convenient so they couldnt collect data on how ineffective my care has been  this isnt a mental health service  it is a medication farm;1;Negative

Samantha;January 11, 2020;update i have to update my review because in the two short weeks since my original review so much has changed first i had the same issue again but this time a new person messaged me and they were completely condescending she didnt look up any of my history or even seem to look at my prescription if she had fact checked she would have known that was she was saying to me was completely false they also charged me for this rx for the first time ever without informing mealso i started a new prescription and wasnt informed of the copay before they sent me the med weeks late i might add since they forgot about it it was 55 i was checking my bank account and saw the charge i tried contacting customer service and they basically said tough luck not our problem apparently customer service also cant answer more than one question at a time because every time i get a reply its only answering one thing i asked about and i have to keep asking the same question over and over againi am ending my service as of now and will be recommending all of my friends that have signed up because of me do the same im absolutely horrified at the lack of care from medical professionals youre supposed to have gone into this field because you want to help people do no harm original review i cant give a full 5 stars because i have had a couple of issues with my rx not shipping when it should due to miscommunication but whenever i bring it to their attention they fix it immediately and do whatever it takes to make sure i get my rx in time;1;Negative
customer;March 01, 2022;i have only been with cerebral for 6 months but am on my third provider due to the first 2 leaving with no warning it was frustrating at first to be shuffled around so often and even left without my meds for a week because there was no provider available to authorize a refill i am now satisfied with my current provider i feel like the actually analyzed and discovered the root cause of my anxiety being related to undiagnosed and untreated adhd i have been doing much better with the regime she has prescribed me i love my care counselor she is so bright bubbly and personable i feel that she truly listens to me because she always starts our session by recapping the last and recalls a lot of details the care team is always responsive whenever i have questions and helpful when i am having issues with scheduling;3;Positive

FJ;September 09, 2020;i dont have traditional insurance to cover mental health matters and wanted to try a specific medication to see if it would help my anxiety and ptsd symptoms after having adverse side effects to ssris in the past however i couldnt find an online service that prescribed that particular medication and didnt know how id get to a doctor during the pandemic and out of pocket i saw an instagram ad for alpha one day and i am usually very wary of sponsored ads particularly when this type of service seems to be springing up everywhere and its hard to know which ones are reputable  but something made me click on that one and i found they offered it as an option and decided to take the plunge the screening i took and results afterward felt very authentic to what id already learned in therapy was going on with me and within a few days i was starting on the medication id wanted to try complete with a bobs burgers gif in my tracking email which told me this company was going to do me right its so helpful  nowadays more than ever  to be able to shoot over a question if i have one and get a fast reply get regular followup screenings to make sure its going well and just walk to my mailbox to get my prescription i was initially a little concerned about getting prescriptions without ever speaking to a person but really the whole process couldnt be easier and i dont feel anythings being taken too lightly very grateful i found this service to help me further address my mental health needs affordably and easily thank you;5;Positive

Ralph Varcoe;August 19, 2024;to start i should say that i love the idea of zoe i signed up after all but its just too basic and slowwe live in a world where we can download an app integrate with other apps get regular updates have regular communication videos posts groups etc we live in a world where we can order a blood test from somewhere like medichecks and get detailed results in around 48 hours likewise with lifesupplywhy then does zoe take 3 weeksthe app is so simple  basically its a document repository with a few quiz questions but the information is so basic laughably sotheres no functionality to sync the zoe app to any others like strava so you can see the impact on blood sugar of exercisingeven the blood sugar monitor isnt integrated into zoe  it requires a separate app nothing is joined upbeware signing up for too long dont sign up for anything more than the minimum if you still feel lucky and decide to go ahead because no matter what you do or say what complaints you have they will not allow you to cancel early they are only interested in your subscription moneyyou cannot talk to anyone either their customer service feels like ai bots rather than peoplei would recommend not signing up with zoe;1;Negative

RH;June 03, 2024;the only real positive of cerebral is that it is convenient and easy to use unfortunately they care more about money than mental health i couldnt afford the subscription anymore but when i cancelled i wasnt eligible for a refill on one of my prescriptions yet and they cancelled all of my refills when i finally was i reached out to them begging to grant me 1 last refill for an antipsychotic while i find a new doctor and they refused and had the audacity to tell me that abruptly discontinuing a medication can have negative and even dangerous side effects so now i am racing against the clock to somehow refill my seroquel before i experience hard withdrawal;2;Negative

customer;October 20, 2023;helloalpha used to be great my wife actually has a yearly subscription but the last time my wife and i used it we were told to go get inperson care  isnt the point of telehealth so you dont have to go out and see a dr especially if you dont have a pcp when youre not feeling well which means you have to go out and spend hours at an urgent care or eri understand being cautious but for my experience i have covid and the dr wouldnt even call in the plaxovid bc i had chest congestion too like im smart enough to know when i need to go to the er if i get worse or have trouble breathing youd think theyd at least help me and give me the medicine to help so i paid  just to be told to get a second opinion even though i knew i had covid i ended up having to find and use a different telemedicine program and got the medicine no problem i did take take the helloalpha drs advice though and found a pcp so i probably wont be using this service anymore;1;Negative

Charlotte BolthouseBartelt;September 01, 2021;the therapist is good for therapy is good the problem is that its extremely hard to get an appointment and they dont let you schedule ahead of time the other problem is that they steal your money and commit fraud because of the inability to make appointments i was told they could have a discount instead of a return which is what they should have done upon the invoice that discount was ignored i contacted customer service after multiple days they did adjust the invoice however when i went to go pay the payment said full price still the customer service person said well just pay it anyway and maybe itll be the discounted price who in the world is going to click yes to an agreement that says youre going to pay one price hoping its a different price thats ridiculous and fraudulent of the company its been three days of me going backandforth about this trying to pay the amount that i actually should be able to pay and being denied they continue to try and take money for a service that has not been rendered ive had a place on my banks fraud list so i have to call and approve any payment to them all of this is documented a fraud and theres documented theft where i say i do not authorize you to take a payment and then i get an email saying they tried to take a payment i cant understand how a company that does everything through email literally writes down fraudulent things and has a documentation that theyre trying to steal from me;3;Negative
Satisfied Customer;October 27, 2023;i started the program this fall and am amazed how much it has helped me when i thought i was already healthy my energy is more stable and i seem to be getting better sleep the personalized nature of it seems to be working well i gave them four stars because i have high standards and would appreciate more directly flagging what about specific food causes high or low scores instead of me digging identifying causes of drops in daily scores even if the score is still high eg fat content or quality and if the app didnt lock up the 23 times per week causing me to have to reenter meals;4;Positive

robert mccormack;October 30, 2024;i would have rated this company negative stars if all possible just on their customer service alonei signed up for the one month subscription realized i didnt use it so before month was done tried canceling my subscription which i thought was done then only to find out they did not in fact cancel my subscription but rather take another month of my card as soon as it was posted today i emailed customer service again to ask why it happened when it was supposed to be canceledthen i get a email saying before they can refund me i have to cancel my subscription once again so after i do this i get a email saying that they are not giving me a refund as i dont qualify for one and the would rather just steal my money i know its only 45 or whatever but its the principal you say cancel before i can get a refund so i cancel again and now you cant refund meas far as i am concerned these people are nothing but a bunch of thiefs and fraudsters and dont care about the clients;1;Negative

Tanya;August 02, 2023;i have been with headway for the past year and a half and it has been a complete godsend for my practice  the rates they negotiated are 2 12 times more than the hourly rate i was making and that coupled a marketing service like zocdoc allowed me to completely fill up my private practice in 1 month  the clients schedule themselves through the app and billing is completely effortless and seamless  i am able to bill for all my patients for the day in about 3 minutes  patients are able to register in the headway system in about 5 minutes and get email reminders the day before their appointment  the only improvement that i have for headway would be to find a way to bill for all the states that i am licensed in as opposed to just one state  it is both an incredible win for clinicians in terms of pay and taking care of all the administration as well as making healthcare much more accessible to patients as prior to headway i did not accept insurance in my practice as it was too onerous;5;Positive

Peter Sharples;September 21, 2024;nothing fantastic negatively or positively to say at this stage but this push for a 5 star rating so early in my experience is a real turn off  come to think of it the 21 play store rating when i downloaded the app immediately upon paying for the programme was also quite disconcertingi wrote the above under a 3 star review  my gut feeling was less but felt i had not sufficient experience to slam liven too hard  i have since read other reviews and although the 5star writeups seem genuinely glowing i highly suspect them to be from folk with lesser expectations  perhaps this is a good tool for them  however the 1star reviews far more accurately reflect my own experiences and concerns  so i have now downgraded my review to 2star based on my own now supported experiences  i will be back to further downgrade if my concerns as i have now seen in others experiences prove to be validshould have come to trustpilot to start with;2;Neutral

Andy Boldyreff;April 28, 2024;do not use this company  they target procrastinators and then make it unclear what you are signing up for which ends up being a subscription  well surprise  procrastinators dont like to do things or look for excuses to get other reward feelings  so procrastinators end up paying money for something they may not use  they offer no phone number and are difficult to get a hold of again perpetuating a scenario where they are charging you  if you need one last clue on this they offer no phone number for support so when you do have problems you cant immediately check it off your list think back to what theyre trying to help procrastinators just another hurdle to jump through to get them to stop billing you am working with my credit card to stop all payments on themthey dont want to help you  they just want to get your money  just plain dont do it  they will respond on here but they will still do what they do so they make money off of people;1;Negative

D.G.;August 05, 2021;my time was short with cerebral due to several factors first off like so many others they do not accept any insurance that is state issued so the first month is usually not to bad as they constantly run sales kinda like the big chain furniture store that runs sales on every holiday  but look out after those 30 days are up depending on the plan you choose it can cost close to 40000 not including your meds if you are prescribed any the people that i dealt with from the 1st assessment  interviewer to the dr assigned aka my provider and my therapist was very nice the only problem that i had was that i had been under care for over 15  years lost dr due to loss of insurance but i had already done the trial of so many medications that did not work for me i did not want to start that all over again its a waste of my time their time not to mention  and no progress or relief for me i know what meds worked for me after many years of trial  error  and could prove it i was willing to sign consent to medical records but was told they have to start out with specific meds 1st before going to the others couldnt give an actual length of time but definitely 90 days or more i couldnt deal with another day let alone 90 and no guarantee that i would get them i found a local place that took my insurance for low income have the same benefits  as cerebral offers plus i  actually get the meds i needed without starting all over my advice check around make some calls before jumping into this unless you just have a free pot of  laying around;3;Neutral

Dave;January 17, 2021;i am new to the program 30 days and am still a little confused about the role differentiation between the counselor and care team when meeting with my counselor the 1st time all was good and my meds were submitted to local pharmacy for 1 med and shipped by you for the second mednow it is time for renewal of my prescription from local pharmacy and shipping of the other from you directlyin the mean time i was contacted by my care team and an initial call scheduled for 45 days after my initial signup the main question i have who is responsible for submitting the renewal to my pharmacy at day 30 for renewali am more than happy to do it myself but probably wont get too far with local pharmacy for the renewal i may simply be confused because this is my first month with you and your organization you seem to have some great people and great concept hopefully i am worrying for no reason time will tell thanks dave;4;Positive

Erin Jones;May 12, 2022;if i could give cerebral 0 stars i would my entire experience with them has been atrocious first they will advertise that they have hundreds of therapists in network for you to choose from and that they will match your preferences such as gender religious affiliation age etc after providing my insurance information which is a major insurance network accepted in most medical settings i was told that there were only two options to choose from and neither of them met any of my preference requests the first therapist i met with ended up cancelling my appointments with little to no notice several weeks in a row and the second therapist would assign a specific daytime and if that didnt work for you then youre sol there was no option to request a different daytime than the one he assigned i wish i could say that being prescribed medication was a better experience but unfortunately it was not i was assured that refills would occur automatically that i would not have to constantly remind them to call it in this was not the case and i frequently ran out of my meds because they would not respond to my request for several days on more than one occasion they would switch who my prescriber was with no notice and i would then have to wait several weeks to see them before they would refill my meds leaving me without medication in the meantime when i expressed concerns about how frustrating it was to be without the medication i needed to live a normal life i was met with nothing but nonchalance and dismissive messages basically stating were sorry you feel that way this company does not care about the mental health or wellbeing of their patients and should be avoided at all costs;1;Negative

Helen Hodgson;June 30, 2023;i had such high hopes of the zoe program and joined  in order to gain knowledge of how to achieve optimum nutrition as a regular listener of the podcast i strongly believe in the science behind itmy kit arrived and i went through what felt like quite a short testing period with no end of problems with the glucose monitor although my data was secure and i received my results as planned i understand that this was not the fault of the team at zoe but it really did affect my confidence although i was provided with one free months support to make up for it anyway i was beginning to get into the swing of things when access to my app ceased without notice i admit that i asked for time to consider how long i wanted support for due to an unforeseen expense my dog became very ill and i suddenly had to find thousands of pounds but when i reached out to the support team i was provided with mixed messages with an average several days response time it was misleading as to how long my membership was going to last hence total surprise when i was suddenly unable to log in any moreprior to this i also found that payments were taken by zoe which i was not expecting to incur and i didnt feel it was clear from the outset precisely how much the program costs there was an initial payment is for the kitspread out if required a further payment for the results and a further charge for the ongoing support the main points i want to raise are1 generally i personally feel that 2 weeks is insufficient time to complete an adequate amount of glucose challenges 2 the total cost of being part of the program was far more more than i believe is made clear3 it would be more affordable to be able to spread payments month my month rather than suddenly find another 299 charged to your account4 i am disappointed not to be part of the zoe program any more but generally feel the support team are understaffed and this may be in part why i am unsure about continuing 5 i now feel unsure as to exactly how much benefit i gained from being part of the program especially after spending around 600 over such a short amount of  time;3;Neutral

Michael;March 21, 2022;after 34 years of mishandling my life and issues i finally reached out for help because i was truly concerned for my future i did research and found a few similar companies but i liked the therapist network with cerebral so i tried it out and was even able to pick my therapist based off my needs and personal background i found sally davis now my life has been very hard and telling people about it normally makes them cry and wonder how im still alive today i was having daily mental breakdowns crying daily i had zero hope in a future for myself had attempted suicide multiple times before felt i didnt matter felt abandoned and just felt like if i passed today it wouldnt be so bad for me a therapist was my last attempt being able to live and be happy and sally did not disappoint while i have a ways to go i can tell you i finally had a breakthrough and for the first time in 34 years i have true hope for my future this lady is a hero not just because of her career profession but its what she puts into it that makes the difference secondly i had a time sensitive urgent issue and i got in contact with sabrina from customer service you know how some customer service agents do nothing but stick to a script and never follow up not sabrina not only did she see a tricky situation but she thought outside of the box and did everything she possibly could just to help she then called back quickly to discuss what she did and how to go about things may not seem like much but from someone who works i customer service i can say people like her are what makes a company works and what helps keep people there if you are on the fence about therapy and need help please give cerebral a try i was also not sure but im so glad i signed up and tried this;5;Positive

Penelope Morris;March 01, 2024;i mainly embarked on the zoe journey as i had had a lot of dietary issues in the past and wanted to see how my microbiome was doing i already had a good idea of food nutrition and ate a healthy diet so i wasnt expecting to learn anything new how wrong was i  the learning process has been the biggest game changer for me in particular understanding my body reaction to saturated fats and how i can improve this through simple changes the combination of foods is fascinating and the scoring system so helpful and motivating i particularly like scanning foods as i shop to find the best options and i can imagine this will takeover from reading tiny labels on food in the near future  in fact this is the preventative treatment that the nhs should be investing in for the future health of all of us i am into my third month now and im logging all of my meals every day which at first seemed a big deal but ive now got used to it i plan to complete 4 months and then likely stop the membership as by then the new habits i have formed will have become normality for me the only reason for the 4 stars and not 5 is that in the beginning had a few issues for me  the cookies in the test were so sweet and dense i literally couldnt eat them all so this may have affected my results also the first week was quite overwhelming with the information coming through and as a result i didnt complete the tasks correctly so leave yourself plenty of time to get going yes its expensive but its the best thing ive invested in for my future health and as others have said the response from the chat is really helpful thanks zoe;4;Positive

Lorene Amet;September 30, 2023;i love the whole zoe experience it is fascinating not just to learn about how we individually respond to food and the tools to mitigate and rebalance but also as a tool to educate the wider population about healthier dietary and lifestyle habits potentially bringing many more years of happy and healthy life to individuals it also provide very powerful means to research providing for the first time as far as i know large group comparisons that are age matched gender matched and ethnicity matched i am scratching my mind to find any negatives perhaps a little overwhelming for people who do not have too much time on their hands or whos diet are limited and imbalanced there will be a lot to learn and time will need to be allocated but its very worthwhile and might be a life saver;5;Positive

lubna;January 02, 2024;the best thing about zoe was having the tests especially the continuous glucose monitor to have some data on how ones body processes foodi also think it is great for someone who has no or limited knowledge about nutrition eg doesnt know the difference between a doughnut and a green chicken salad andor is looking to lose weight in my experience beyond the test phase it doesnt add value if you have a  decent enough knowledge about food are not looking to lose weight or to form better eating habits  because yours are already good  my attempts to get nuanced advice from the advisers did not get anywhere  i was not ever sure if i was speaking to an agent or a nutritionist such was the nature of the advice  none of them seemed to take on board that i had an excellent gut biome and diet  and was trying to eat better to manage poor fat and sugar responses both of which were hereditary my particular equation isnt one that zoe is designed to help and i would have liked zoe to have said so instead i was dragged along by them until i cancelled update ive noted the two responses from zoe to my review ive already spent enough time and energy trying to get actionable useful guidance  an example is zoes insistence that i should focus on my daily score whereas i was clear that i wanted to flatten my sugar curve as much as possible i noticed that zoe scoring was telling me that there were foods i could enjoy freely such as courgetteartichoke and yet the more granular details on these foods obtained by clicking again showed that both these were bad for my blood sugar  to me this meant that they should not be categorised as enjoy freely zoe advisers disagreed;2;Neutral

Seth Beaugh;June 12, 2022;when i first signed up for alpha i was under the impression that my medication would come in the mail every month at a specified date this is actually what happened for the first few months but then for some reason around the fourth or fifth month i would have to remind alpha to send my medication this normally happened when i was running low on my current dose of venlafaxine effexor and realized that the new months supply might not make it to me on timea couple of weeks ago i ran into the same situation i was running low on my current prescription of venalfaxine and when the new months supply hadnt come in the mail yet i messaged alpha a few of days before my then current supply ran out after two or three days of waiting they responded and said that they were sending out my new prescription but it was too late it did not arrive before i ran out of my venlafaxine pills for the monthsince this is one of the hardest antidepressants to come off of in terms of side effects the withdrawal i felt during the two days when i didnt have my medication was brutal crazy brain zaps intense vertigo insane mood swingsi could barely function i couldnt work i felt miserable eventually my new month supply made it to me but the pain i felt while it wasnt there was terrible alpha should have mailed me my prescription in a timely manner but they failed to do so theyre unreliable and unstable;1;Negative

Marcus A;May 16, 2024;i personally wouldnt recommend zoe it is really expensive and doesnt offer value for money if you are wanting to get personalised information on your health and wellbeing i would check what else is out there before committing to a subscription i chose zoe because i wanted get a handle on my health and gain an insight into how my environment affects me and my body as a young person who has been unfortunate enough to have suffered from various underlying health conditions over the years i was excited to gain insight into factors which could improve my health unfortunately zoe wasnt the plan for me dont rush into trying something make sure you do what is right for you and your body updated 05 june 2024 i thank zoe for their correspondence with me on my review i did make zoe aware that i was unable to continue with the service on the advice of my doctor unfortunately my underlying health conditions have meant that i was unable to proceed with the programme i put to zoe that their interest lies in their profit over the care of their customers  to which they gave the following responseplease know that our focus remains on our customers and we are continually working to balance this with the sustainability of our businessit would appear to me that zoe has drawn that line in the wrong place and that their desire to make money surpasses the care they have for their customers particularly those who end up being unable to participate in the programme or to even complete the testing who will be liable to pay hefty fees if you do consider choosing zoe and do take on a subscription be mindful of those implications their terms and conditions state in exceptional circumstances for example if you submit an order but are then told by your physician that you should not participate zoe may in its absolute discretion refund some or all of the fees you have paidzoe does not apply this discretion lightly and chose not to apply it in my case not only had i paid 200 but am told i need to pay the remaining 100 if youre unfortunate enough to have underlying health conditions zoe will make you pay every penny despite being unable to utilise the testing or service please be mindful;1;Negative

Alicia Richter;March 03, 2022;make sure this is the company you want to work with when you sign up as they are completely unsympathetic if you change your mind i was attempting to find help as soon as i could i looked into them and a program through my insurance i signed up with cerebral however that same day i heard back from my insurance and was able to find local help i was maybe registered with their company for a couple hours received no services whatsoever and they are refusing to give me a full refund they have refunded 30 however the money i lost i need to put towards the care i am getting with my new provider as if finding mental health help isnt stressful enough this really didnt help people make mistakes sign up and change their minds and are just trying to navigate whats best for them and yet this company is not willing to refund my full amount im pretty sure a company as large as this can spare it truly upsetting;1;Negative

Aixa;September 22, 2021;i really love the idea of the app and i like that i dont have to leave wherever i am in order to meet my therapist i also like that you can see a psychiatrist in the same app and get medication prescribed my issue is that to pay 80 a month and to only see my therapist once a month if im lucky for only 30 minutes is insane i feel like im making no progress with my therapist because 30 minutes fly by and its just like im telling my friend about my issues and i can do that for free yes you can message them over text which is nice but for some me included it feels a bit awkward with the coordinator also in the same message thread;2;Neutral

Rainbow Creations;March 13, 2024;i signed up for zoe testing last november the report you get back is so thorough and an eye opener i am plant based and have been for many years vegetarian before that but i had started to slip into having vegan convenience food in the freezer which after a day at work and a hungry monkey on my shoulder lead to me being very lazy and eating far too much highly processed foods zoe gave me a massive list of foods that are good for my blood sugar blood fats and gut nothing is off menu the aim is to regularly score high and zoe shows you how to food combine to achieve this i regularly score 70 i continue to use the app and record my meals everyday i look forward to the sunday improve report which shows how you have done during the week i know my metabolism has been shot over the years by me doing stupid diets taking pills and potions that promise me all sorts of miracles with zoe this has all been about health improving my gut biome has improved my general well being  ibs symptoms have disappeared i feel more energetic i meal prep every weekend so i know i have great food waiting for me when i get home and if that monkey is screaming at me the the almond and peanut butter cookies that dont spike my blood sugars are on standby i love using zoe im hoping my metabolism will eventually repair and maybe i will start to lose a few pounds if you looking for a quick fix diet then zoe may not be for you and you will think its expensive if you want to change your mindset of the way and the food you eat want to be educated and go forward with an improved general health then zoe is worth the investment  support is great the podcasts are so informative i give zoe a massive 5 out of 5;5;Positive

Alisia Robinson;May 03, 2022;i went to cerebral after being let down a multitude of times by mental health professionals in my adhd concerns ive been judged stigmatized wait listed and actually abandoned in the middle of being treated after being prescribed non stimulation 3rd line antidepressant that could help with adhd symptoms medication that wasnt good for me got so bad i had to stop on my own after weeks of trying to reach out and no responseall this during a global pandemic where health care professionals were already overwhelmed i couldnt have chose a better time to get checked for adhd sarcasmi came across cerebral and decided to give it a shot the badi wont lie due to my own lack of knowledge and adovcating for myself i stayed with my first presciber longer than i should of  my first presciber while extremely nice was too passive and seemed to really lean toward one medication that stopped working and was making feel really badregardless of if i expressed trying something else it would end up with me seeing how i feel or another dose increase they seemed to be afraid of prescribing stimulants i can understand why with the stigma around it and it being a controll substance that is commonly abused unfortunately that fear didnt do much to help me and made me feel worse each time i took it so i stopped taking the medication and reached out to my team as a final try i expressed my concernsadvocated for myself and was paired with a new prescriberthe good my new prescriber listened to my needs asked me deeper questions and isnt as passive when it comes to my treatment they even check in on me outside of the video appointment now for my care counselor im absolutely in love my care counselor is so so amazing and i feel like ive made strides with her since starting she holds me accountable teaches me new skills i can actually use and has been the most help ive ever had while talking to someone as a mental health professionaltherapist like if i could just see her id be happy ill be so sad if she were to ever leave cerebral honestly if she does i think id go too because shes the only reason thats worth staying on for overall my experience with cerebral started off rocky and bitter sweet with a great care counselor and a questionable prescriber after the switch it really balanced itself out and i couldnt be happier though i do have one annoyance is the constant switching of coordinators ive probably had about 45 since starting id like to have one thats consistent another thing id like to have is reviews for the care counselor  i have yet to have been able to write one for mine and i would like to give her praise for what she does individually i was beginning to get apprehensive about cerebral due to some bad reviews but im thinking now its definitely depends on location and the resource of doctors nps psychiatrist  etc they have for each area;5;Neutral

Sarah Lawrence;February 08, 2024;i have just completed 4 months of the zoe program and i am now renewing again for the first time in my life i have finally got to understand how my body works what i need and what i dont want to have entering my body in particular i have stopped eating processed foods whilst at home i think far more about what i am preparing and cooking and although i know it is not a weightloss programme i have lost 8 kgs i love the recipes although hard for one person at times so i do have to freeze or eat the same dish  the next day i really enjoy the podcasts and they are generally my morning listenings my only worry is that i lead a pretty good social life that means i eat and drink out a fair bit or at friends homes where i can i try to be careful but am not beating myself up over this feeling guilty or losing friends i do what i can and certainly feel so much better than i did before starting zoe it is expensive for a pensioner  but hopefully the longterm benefits will show;5;Positive
Lulu Fidler;January 06, 2024;so far my experience has been great any infrequent glitches with the app get solved quickly enough the conversations do close quickly but reopening them gets results the science behind this is very informative and i love the fact that it is so personalised ive learnt a lot about my body responses to food some of which are surprising but the fact that i can do something about it and being shown how is a godsend it would be good if all the recipes used either cups or grams or handfuls rather than mix and match im constantly having to google amounts and temps on the oven as i have gas  i love the lessons and podcasts and the weekly review of how im doing also the odd reminder see how to improve my meals regarding in my case fibre intake its like having a personal nutritionist by your side wish it had been around years ago;5;Positive

Gill Brooks;January 23, 2024;ive been reading about nutrition for several years including books by tim spector  trying to find solution to my weight problem i was happy to join zoe last july i now know that i process blood sugar and fat in my blood poorly this alone was worth it because its what i suspected the programme provides me with masses of info access to a nutrition coach  recipes and a series of lessons  and a logging system which im familiar with as a veteran user of noom and my fitness palive also used intermittent fasting which reduced the pain in my arthritic knees  i really feel im part of a whole new way of understanding health led by zoe;4;Positive
DG;July 20, 2024;ive loved doing the zoe programme thought i had a healthy diet but finding out that both my glucose metabolism and fat metabolism were badpoor has been really helpful zoe teaches how to combine foods to mitigate glucose spikes and helps with adjusting recipes to make them healthier increasing fibre and protein in my daily meals has meant i have fewer carbs and am not hungry husband very happy with our change in diet  more beans and salads  and i dont think well ever look back lost 10kg weight without really trying and its staying off ive been a member for a year and sad to see it go but i feel optimistic i can manage on my own now would love the option of a zoe light membership where i could check new foods and recipes but sadly not available;5;Positive
Natasha O'Farrell;December 08, 2024;for the price the value i receive is incredible the somatic exercises alone have helped me slow down and work on my mindset along with loosen my body up to be as flexible as i was 10yrs ago i cant say enough about it;5;Positive
Miller21;March 23, 2022;i did not really feel mentally more stable they will prescribe you medication but care coordinator duties are not like therapist duties so they dont really ask whats going on in youre life just how the meds help its just a weird program you see a doctor for meds once in awhile and a care coordinator to make sure you get the meds but its not therapy at all just a way to get meds honestly which is not what i needed;2;Negative

Lisa Bauer;May 22, 2021;i was going to have to wait over 2 months to even see an mdnp in person i completed the alpha assessments in the evening and had a conversation going with an np the next morning meds were decided upon and shipped to me my insurance covered most of the cost and i received them in just a few days under a week from assessment to medication received i also felt very included in the decision for medication i stated what ive used in the past and what my preferences are based on those experiences and i felt really heard like my input was valuable this is important to me in a world filled with doctors you have to wait several weeksmonths to see to then spend five minutes with them not being listened to i highly recommend this service for medical needs that dont require lab workin person assessment;5;Positive
CollectPlus Customer;December 01, 2023;an app that teaches a lot about healthy eating and balancing food to support the gut microbiome and keep sugar and fat levels at a good level helpful staff to guide you and help with queries my only concern is that a number of people have seen the app as a weight loss tool that is not its intention from my understanding but maybe that applies to people who have a poor idea of healthy eating in the first place good recipes and tips on the app;4;Positive

Elizabeth Luetmer;January 24, 2024;i am impressed with the zoe program  however in the original testing there were many complications with the glucose monitor not working properly  definitely a plant focused program and food suggestions are based on the average person your age and sex if you are an athlete or have requirements outside the normal population those things are not accounted for and not adjustable in your plan feedback also no retesting available yet in the usa;4;Positive
Jesse Miller;October 30, 2022;i was a member for three months then closed my acct 1 for 80month i received a care counselor 30minmonth and a practitioner 1530 minmonth neither felt like enough time to accomplish anything 2 to speak with your consoler or practitioner you must message your care coordinator to initiate communication this was fine until i had a severe medical concern and attempted to contact my physician the coordinator would not send my message until i explained the situation to them over text i expressed i was not comfortable doing so and the coordinator never passed along my message luckily i had an appt scheduled already in the coming days this act was careless 3 i closed my account after the above experience and selected issue with my care team cerebral didnt care to ask why they just offered me a discount to continue my service my consoler and physician were great but i didnt make any significant progress due to the short appt window and time between appointments from the research ive done the ceo has faced scrutiny for focusing more on profit rather than the care of their patients;3;Neutral

Michael Deweert;May 22, 2024;good with some caveats the zoe app ai is very good at taking information about foods in various quantities and units and computing nutrition information  saves me a lot of work i also appreciate having the zoe scores for how my meals likely impact my blood sugar fat metabolism and microbiome the zoe staff are friendly and knowledgeable  i appreciate their answers to my question on the other hand this is definitely not a weight  loss program i have can have a  high score every day and still gain weight also  while zoe claims that no foods are offlimits achieving a high score requires eating some foods in such small quantities that they might as well be off limits all in all zoe is very useful  but not the only arrow in my nutrition quiver;4;Positive

Anonymous;September 29, 2020;i have struggled with anxiety and depression for the past 15 years of my life i currently live in a small town with limited healthcare options i was advised to seek online help through a local mental health facility  i took the health assessment and signed up for online medication management and care counseling i honestly and openly discussed my illness to my provider and care counselor  my provider immediately started me on medication to manage me depression and anxiety and i was excited to be getting help again however after meeting with my care counselor unbeknownst to me she decided that i was more suitable for in person treatment and sent me a chat to say this  the website is basically unnavigable and i was unable to see this chat i consequently waited for medication that wasnt going to come and was charged an additional month before i reached out to support who informed me of the chat sent by my care counselor  i complained to support and they refunded my money and canceled my subscription  this whole process was extremely frustrating i am merely trying to get help and i cant seem to get it through online or in person methods  if i wasnt a good candidate for treatment cerebral should have mentioned this after my health assessment or my visit with provider at the very least an email shouldve been sent telling me my care counselors opinion instead of a chat which i could not access  by sending me an email i could have sought treatment from another source quicker and may not have gone through with drawls from my medication  and the fact that my care counselor suggested in person treatment during a global pandemic where most doctors offices arent seeing patients was laughable furthermore i should have never been charged in the first place for a service that they were refusing me;2;Neutral

Jack Pegg;July 02, 2024;i went through the programme near the start of the year and overall had an ok experience there were some useful insights and any questions i had were answered fairly promptly through the chat i decided that for me personally the membership wasnt worth it so i stopped after 1 monthcut to a few months later and i request access to my data from the testing at the start of the programme specifically my gut microbiome results and im told i have to rejoin the programme to gain accessthis feels like a massive slap in the face ive turned a lot of people onto their podcast paid a whole lot of money to do their tests even opted to let them use my data for research usually id be the one getting paid for this not the other way around and tried out their programme before deciding its not for me right nownow in return all im asking for is for someone to take 2 seconds to essentially export a pdf and email it to me and theyre asking for me to pay for a whole new membership all of their pricing separates out the monthly cost of the membership from the oneoff cost of the testing so i dont see how me stopping my membership suddenly means you can take back what i paid 300 for so you can try and get me to pay even more moneyi get this is all in their terms and conditions but regardless its left me feeling exploited and i wont be recommending or engaging with anything zoe in the future;1;Negative
Lyn Edwards;January 04, 2024;one month into the zoe programme and i am pleased to say i have found it very beneficial the test results were very interesting luckily for me i have good blood sugar and blood fat responses but i am working to improve my gut microbiome which is poor it would be very helpful if one could get the poop test done again periodically to monitor progress  i like being able to keep tabs on my nutritional intake and adjust my diet accordingly i would definitely recommend doing zoe;4;Positive

Jenn;January 27, 2023;my initial experience was great and my provider got to me right away answered any questions quickly and had my medication sent to my pharmacy right away  however if you need a prior authorization for a medication or need them to send a response to your pharmacy then i dont recommend using this company  i did all the legwork and got them exactly everything they needed to get a quick response over to the pharmacy which was very simple and straightforward but they tell you it can take up to 25 business days to send a response back which isnt acceptable when they charge you monthly and you arent able to do the follow you are already going to pay for since you wont have the medication yet  if they have issues with staffing and demand then they should stop taking on patients until they can fix the issue;1;Negative

Ian;January 31, 2024;i left the zoe program in disgust at staff not knowing things their inability to tell me where things were on the app how to use it properly and utterly bewildering and infuriating incompetence when it came to taking my payments instead of taking 59 on one occasion they instead took 200 just after christmas when i had less money available they refunded everything and apologisedand now ive left the app i get regular emails that dont connect with reality todays being that im flying through my lessons and must be feeling the benefits so why dont i share my experience with others to encourage them to sign up well i am sharing my experience a very poor one and im not encouraging anyone to sign upgiven that the latest spam email is asking me to get others to sign up note to zoe i dont work for you so im not going to do marketing for you for free for your profit margin but im not signed up anymore its clear they arent very professional and on the ballgiven that they are now getting into food products which only do more or less than the same as current ones on the market its clear zoe is becoming a corporate brand with more of the same corporate self aggrandising spin so prevelant in our times;1;Negative

Khloe Fitzgerald;June 14, 2022;so far this experience has been super smooth and simple my biggest hesitance tbh was the stress of finding a psychiatrist counselor therapist the list could go on but cerebral makes it super easy to do it all in one my team has also been so super kind understand  helpful i highly recommend giving it a shot if nothing else;5;Positive

Derbyshire Mum;April 17, 2023;i have absolutely loved the zoe programme  i found the testing fascinating and despite scoring very well in all areas i have still both lost weight and improved my health by following their methodology  its centred around adding foods in rather than taking them away which is a joy and im actually consuming more calories than i was before  i am in my late 40s but suffering from axial spondyloarthritis and this time last year was in significant pain  i was already eating what i thought was a healthy whole food based and nonupf diet  however the changes i have made via zoe along with intermittent fasting inspired by the zoe podcasts and what tim spector says about it have meant that for the first time in years my condition is improved  my digestion seems to work far better and more consistently than it used to iyswim and i would advocate the programme for anyone  have only given a 4 because the customer team response times can be slow and because its not available on the web yet  there are various user niggles but overall its excellent;4;Positive

Mercedes;August 05, 2021;alpha medical withdrew 470 from my account without my authorization they said that by me completing a consultation im agreeing to medical treatment so i guess that means if i go to my pcp theyre allowed to drain my money from my account and shove medication down my throat nope over the last year they were always very communicative with me and made sure to go over copays and cash payments before charging me i was always given the option to approve or deny before moving forward this time they prescribed me 3 medications that i did not request and would have been clear if they would have looked at my history at 2 am sunday and by the time i woke up in the morning all of my money was gone and the order had been processed after a week of trying to dispute these transactions with them i finally received a partial refund the following morning they charged my account another 125 after someone had already told me all of my future orders have been cancelled the 125 was from an order they could not charge me for because they had already put my bank account in the negative that previous sunday thankfully i received a refund the following week i was a loyal customer and would recommend them to everyone but now i have them blocked from my bank and i no longer plan to continue with alpha medical moving forward because of this i was unable to keep food on the table and missed a car payment;1;Negative

Jane S;November 08, 2023;its early days for me on the zoe plan but so far so good finding out what foods dodont work for my biology is both surprising and a delight some foods i assumed would be ok for me arent and a lot of foods ive historically avoided or kept to minimum i can now eat regularlyfreely and guilt free that said nothing is banned and i usually eat what i want as long as i take care with my meal planning being able to understand my blood sugarfat responses as well as whats going on in my gut biome has been a revelation and i do hope this will one day become the norm for everyone under the nhs it certainly helps me feel more responsible for my health ive signed up for a year believing i need a decent length of time to make the changes i want and for them to become a part of my normal life this has cost me 600 but as someone else has already written i guess it depends on the value you put on your own health and wellbeing that said if you buy a 3 coffee every working day for a year then youll have paid 780 for that  making zoe comparatively cheap i would chosen a 6 month option had that been available but at the time of joining there was a choice of 1 month 4 month or a yearany queries ive had have been answered within given timescales and replies have been very comprehensive for me although weight loss is an important part of this journey becoming more healthy is of paramount importance to me that said a few weeks in and im down just about half a stone and it doesnt feel like ive been trying to lose weight ive even been eating chocolate as part of my eating plan bonusthis plan does require quite a lot of commitment to food planning i was already eating reasonably healthily but im still having to make quite a number of substantial changes to the way i eat logging meals is an important part of measuring this for me and it does take time especially in the beginning when logging recipes and meals for the first time i think it will get easier as time passes though although they say theres no obligation to log meals i fail to see how i would get the best of the plan without doing so at least for the first few months anyway i find the improve section of the app most helpful every week which i wouldnt have if i dont log my meals so for me this a definitely worth the purchase but be aware of the time commitment required in order to get the best out of the app;5;Positive

Emilia Lozano;July 04, 2022;the website is not user friendly and since this is a webbased business this is a big problemive often had the experience of asking a question about medication or the site and have gotten a canned response which makes me think no intelligent person is reading my message and understanding the problem im havingor i get a response that says im using the site wrong with no additional helpul instruction on how to use the site properlythe customer service is prompt but if they are not addressing the correct problem how good it is i feel like im in a monty python sketch;1;Negative

Izabela Turlewicz;May 24, 2024;the best aspects are personal scores and advice as well as educational aspects around nutrition otherwise i have been utterly disappointed with my membership its literally impossible to get proper nutrition coach support i got replies to my messages after 3 days from different people unless its ai anyway as replies have been generic so you cannot really have a conversation id say skip the membership or do it for 1 month only as absolutely not worth it and it ruined my experience with zoe id say for this budget youd get similar results and 1 on 1 advice from an independent well qualified nutritionistdietician as many offer the same tests nowadays thats what ill be doing next;2;Neutral

Customer;August 01, 2024;i appreciate this companys integrity i subscribed to a weekly payment plan which i was unaware was temporary after three months i thought i had read all the fine print i could and was set for my mental health journey unfortunately i was charged an annual fee and really did not expect nor was prepared to pay my bank account was in 60 at the beginning of the week and my next pay was two fridays awayi took a chance to reach out to support and they graciously refunded the fee i wish it was a weekly payment app because it really did help shed light on a lot of my dark days im introverted and rather read expert advice than receive it verbally like in a therapy session setting or group therapy setting i whole heartedly apppreciate the three months i used the the liven app as affordable an annual fee it may be as opposed to using insurance and having wait list for therapists and in person mental health care its not budgetable for me right nowso i regretfully have to find another outlet but the app was super helpful for me and my times of mental health needs;5;Positive

Anon;February 19, 2022;seems scattered unorganized and a little frantic i have multiple diagnoses from previous doctors and the providers at cerebral seem uninformed overworked and frankly robotic the time restrictions dont allow for them to give their spiel and actually be responsive or receptive to a patients issues the care counselor i started with was very nice and i enjoyed talking with her but she was replaced by a different person shortly after our first two meetings there are a lot of changes and inconsistences the people handling my account have changed multiple times with no notice it is unsettling and also challenging to reiterate the same basic things to new people every couple of weeks i keep track of my own progress and have selfdirected most of my care they also do not follow throughi had to request my invoices with the proper coding multiple times in order to submit them to my insurance cerebral doesnt seem to have a problem getting in touch when the payment doesnt go through but customer service seems to lack in response when requesting specifics or trying to handle simple questions i also couldnt get a proper response about cancellation i was ultimately offered a discount in lieu of cancellation i chose this option so i could buy myself some time as i try to find another provider;2;Positive

Adam Wasson;November 26, 2021;this company makes it clear they dont care about their patients they bounce you around between a care team and you hardly ever talk to the same person which leads to having to repeat yourself over and overi had an appointment scheduled with my prescriber and i rearranged my schedule so i could make it after waiting 45 minutes my prescriber still hadnt shown up when i reached out to the company i was told that my prescriber had marked that i had missed the appointment i have screenshots showing that i was there and my prescriber wasnton monday i requested a refill on my medication but was told that i cant get a refill without meeting with my prescriber first i repeated what had happened to two different people and was told the same thing i pointed out that my prescriber doesnt have any open appointments for 3 weeks and asked if they just expected me to go without my medication until then its been 3 days and i havent gotten a response;1;Negative

AK;November 10, 2024;update confirming that exercises are indeed good and feeling better for it but the tech doesnt stack up website buffers constantly and often needs to refreshed when refreshed the workout isnt recorded as completed have received emails asking to reset cache etc but it doesnt help last email said to use teh iphone app instead but my profile isnt synced so id be starting from day 1 on the app without knowing whether it would be any better company just needs to invest some dev time or upgrade their servers as its very frustrating having the screen freeze half way through a drill and not knowing whether it will eventually restarti think the exercises are good but the tech is not great i have to do each session twice before its acknowledged by the app and opens up the next days session i downloaded the iphone app to see if using it would make sure the workouts are recorded but the workout plan in the app doesnt match the version on my laptop and the little progress recorded on my laptop doesnt match up to iphone app  it appears theres no syncing between the two platforms ive emailed support about it messaged on social channel and still no response i do think this could be a good purchase but it will take me 56 days to do my first 28 sessions at this rate;2;Positive

Linda Sklar;April 23, 2022;this therapy is a scam  had a 19 minute initial evaluation from a prescriber who was sitting in her kitchen the tv was so loud in the background i had to ask her to turn it down then in a lifeless manner she asks me a series of yes and no questions about my mood and anxiety and tells me she will prescribe zoloft after i told her in the beginning i cant tolerate that class of medicine she says oh yea i forgot and then says she will give me lexapro which is the same ssri class she knew nothing all of these venture capital funded online mental health treatment companies are just rich people capitalizing on the pandemic online model cerebral is run by a 30 year old joke of a ceo with absolutely no medical background who is clearly a total narcissistlook how many employees including csuite who are abruptly leaving read the bloomberg article about the reality of cerebralcom and they buy these positive reviewsdont believe them the real owners dont give the slightest damn about quality healthcarethey just want to have hyper growth go public and then cash out stick with a local in person doctor your mental health is way too important;1;Negative

Robert Smith;December 26, 2023;im very much someone who does not believe opinion i like to see and feel proof i know from experience that denial does not work long term with food managementwhether you are seeking help manage food intake or just want to change how you feel zoe makes this possiblecould i have kicked my diabetes into submission in 6 months without it possibly but zoe has made it easier given me the reinforcement i needed and helped remind me each day i dont always agree with the scores they give but i dont cheat them im a good cook which helps but their recipes really helptexture is always the biggest issue for me so getting food with bite and crunch and resistance has been difficult but ive done it that and stop eating carbsor at least stop eating simple carbs who knew bread was my nemesis eat well to feel wellit is not easy it is not always satisfying and you need to find your own path through which works for you but they give you the tools to do itit is also not cheap but frankly it is worth every pennyi have reduced my weight by 35 stone my waist line is 6in reduced and my belly more i have energy again i have far less inflammation issues i can think and feel normal again and im enjoying life againi recommend giving this a go to anyone who asksit is working for me;4;Positive

Heather;May 12, 2023;i think they need to work on their communication  specifically how the process works exactly they recommended medication which i ordered through their partner pharmacy which delivers 1014 days i was told id be charged but no link to pay ever came even when i asked my practitioner i didnt like that i had several people assigned to  they should stick with one to build trust and continuity overall its a good concept and alternative to going to the dr in person for everything;3;Positive

Tyla Aston;February 18, 2024;if i could put 5 rating i would  i cancelled my subscription well and truly before the renewal date  and yet when renewal date roll around i was charge the renewal subscription  when you are on the website you cant physically cancel your subscription you have to submit a request via email to do so buyers beware you can receive confirmation that its cancelled but unfortunately they will still take your money  and what that means is you will have to actual cancel your card or change your bank account reorganise half your life because they refuse to refund your renewal fees and for an added bonus will continue to charge you regardless of your request to cancel  and as a kicker this no manager to escalate to and a policy in their tcs states they dont do refund under any circumstances they need to be shutdown  do not purchase unless you have money to burn;1;Negative

CM;November 19, 2023;the zoe program is very good  but   trying to find the correct food to put in the diary is not at all easy the search engine brings up ideas for every word in your search and most of them have absolutely nothing to do with what youre looking for also customer service used to be pretty good but now it seems that theyre using ai to interact with you and trying to ask anything just puts you in a circle the program has certainly helped me even though the frustration level keeps going up;3;Positive

YMG;November 27, 2024;the zoe program deserves 5 stars the service via the bot chat and email is why im giving this 1 star there are so many limitations to what the delayed help can provide and so much unclear information about ordering and the costs of the subscription program there are no refunds given despite this as a subscriber with the newly launched zoe30 nutsseeds mixture i only get 15 off on black friday yet anyone else gets 20 off why is my loyalty penalized;1;Neutral

Michelle Eubanks;October 25, 2022;totally unacceptable i have waited an extensive amount of time on someone to review my appointment they post 72 hours and in some places advertise 24 hours but i am far far beyond a 72 hour turn around time the one thing they did do on time was take their money for an appointment they have not even provided they were more responsive on my first appointment ive been a operations director for 20 years and new patients are a practice life source my insight would be a new patient appointment has a higher priority to sink the hook in and then returning patients have to wait in line and hope someone gets to them ive resorted to writing a review to deter others who may be entertaining using this company so they dont face the same stale experience im on day 10 at this point ill post again tomorrow and everyday until i hear back;1;Negative

Marcia Edwards;October 18, 2024;absolutely untrustworthy you are better off working with your pcp to acquire the help you need if you sign up for their service at 6400 there is no guaranteed you will receive the care or medication you are looking to obtain they advertise that it is a seamless process and it is not you must have a diagnosis of diabetes to receive weight loss management if you truly have diabetes you should simply work with your pcp and avoid the excessive 6400 monthly charge from helloalpha i have not witnessed such fabrication of what a company can do until now beware;1;Negative

Caitlin Ichigol;October 12, 2021;for years i struggled with feeling like there was something just fundamentally wrong but could never put my finger on it i had a string of therapists that never seemed to stick as the labor of getting to and from appointments and the price made it hard to feel like my problems were worth the effortthen almost on a whim i signed up for cerebral because i figured that maybe the free diagnostic would put a name to my feelings the care team i was partnered to was instantly in my corner i felt truly heard for the first time and was approached with empathy and a mindset towards finding my comfort never about fixing me or making me feel broken i have been with cerebral for a couple of months now and the gently insistent reminders for appointments with my care team helps keep me on track for my goals without feeling like im being pressured and helps me get the most out of my care i cant promise a universal experience but for me at least i feel more whole and satisfied with myself than i can ever remember feeling and it wouldnt have happened without this team of people looking out for me;5;Positive

AG;September 26, 2022;this has been without a doubt the absolute worst excuse for a medical provider i have ever encounteredi started with circle medical for an adhd evaluation they performed this service and then referred me out to cerebral i started on the medicationtherapy plan for which cerebral claims anthem and other companies are innetwork and they will directly bill your insurancefirst the billing piece is a lie they never submitted a claim to my insurance until i tried to submit the other plans invoices which took months to get from cerebral because the receipts they give you are not insurance compliant the claims they did submit did not match the dates or prices on my invoices basically they charged me 139 and told my insurance theyd billed me 255 if you do the medicationcare counseling plan they will not bill your insurance or provide invoices you can submit to your insurance unless you hound them about it and after all that anthem at least refuses to accept the claims because cerebral is innetwork but doesnt bill them directlysecond i switched off the therapy plan because youre paying for four therapy sessions a month i got one session in over a monthlong period cerebral needed to reassign my therapist i guess and took a month to do so and then assigned someone random originally you get to pick based on their profilespecialties with no nearterm availabilitythird the actual services are not great it took seven months to get any adjustment in my medication when the entire purpose of the service was medication management i had been on the same medications for over a year starting about eight months before signing up with cerebral without progress before i finally got changes in my medication the prescriber clearly never read my file and would argue with me about strange things like saying id been prescribed a medication for adhd that id been taking for years before ever being diagnosed with adhd the care counselor was good but that was the only positivecustomer service is not very responsive and definitely not helpful theyll go back and forth with you for weeks in their chat before telling you to email someone specific instead i couldnt even get them to give me my prescribers phone number when my own doctor requested it because the prescriber told me to ask them to write my prescriptions since she cant telehealth providers can no longer prescribe controlled substances like stimulant medications instead they took two weeks to send me my own medical recordsthis has been a horrible horrible experience i shouldve been able to easily submit my invoices for reimbursement and i cant get any of them processed because of cerebrals sketchy billing which leaves me out over 1000 i never would have paid if i had known it would go this way avoideta the prompt response to a critical review is admirable but for the fact that ive been in correspondence with them for literal months about all of this i just spent 30 more minutes on messaging cerebral and anthem about the exact same issues oh and i wanted to add that ive just discovered that my prescriber was misgendering me a trans person in my medical records the amount of stress this behavioral health service has caused and the amount of time ive wasted dealing with them and my insurance to get nowhere again avoid;1;Negative

Don T;February 11, 2024;what a joketook a month for this to come and when i finally got around to putting in a start date i could not change it at the last minute so had to start the day after but this threw the app out and made it confusing this is the worst app i have seen badly designed not intuitive at all makes no sense and has no straight forward structure to it this is not cheap and i expect a lot better the videos about the zoe project or whatever it is called are well done and make you think your going to get a professional medical analysis and mot done but so far i hate this crappy app the app is the worst this about this so far i logged out of the app and when i logged back in its now saying to choose a start date again even though i have spent the entire day doing lessons logging food etc etc which i think is all gone now i will see what the the support is like tomorrow i will be more than happy to change this review if i am proved wrong i hope i am but im not holding my breath;1;Negative

Veronica Cure;February 28, 2022;this service was great in the beginning then a few months in it wasnt this was fraud and a farce monthly payments to speak to someone at inconvenient times months apart care councilor only ever asked me if my medication was working she spent the entire 30 minutes on that one question and typing she would ask me the same questions about my medication in that same session over and over after a while i stopped attending my opinion is she was multitasking she was definitely working on other things as 30 minutes to type a one sentence response for that same question is ridiculous actually the one time i was sobbing and  needed to talk she was unfazed and cold and told me i had 15 minutes left so i never opened up to her again i only kept cerebral this long because of my medication but then i stopped receiving those too i havent seen a bottle of medication in about 8 weeks last refill was december 9th and its february 2nd once your class action suits begin i will gladly be joining them this is fraud and someone is eventually going to do something about it or worse someone is going to end up hurting themselves or another with the way this company operates its only a matter of time daily mail did an entire article about the cerebral fraud a mere month ago more and more people are catching up on the garbage this has turned into;1;Negative

Laurence Due Garde;January 07, 2024;i have been a month with zoe and so far it has been the most informative nutrition study i have experienced it is expensive but a great investment for once healthit takes a little time to find out where things are in the app but eventually one gets there the nutrition team is amazing very helpful kind and supportive i have realised how much i was always eating the same foods and introduced many new things and tastes in my diet which make my meals much more exciting i havent lost weight but this is my own fault for getting a bit carried away and wanting to eat too many different things in one meal only one downside one cannot log any supplements and at least in my case i get a lot of mushroom capsules that could count as plant diversity perhaps in the future something else that could be helpful is to be able to print recipes and all the information we get on the app so one can have their little printed file much easier to go to than on the phone mostly when cooking a recipe everyone should do it at least once i wish as well that there was a possibility of doing a gut test regularly to see progress and adjust what needs to be adjusted hopefully a possibility soon a great experience so far and highly recommended ;4;Positive

Penny C;October 19, 2023;i joined zoe as my sister in law said she had really benefited from following the programme i was a little sceptical as to the effects as we already ate a healthy balanced diet but it has been fascinating learning the effect of individual foods and my husband and i have changed our diet more extensively than i expected with the result that i have both lost weight and now feel much more energetic  its perhaps not quite as personalised as it suggests but overall its been a hugely worthwhile experience and i will certainly stick with the changes weve made  ive been busy recommending zoe to anyone who will listen;5;Positive
Sue;May 02, 2022;i specifically wrote in my notes that i needed one certain medication as soon as she got on she told me she doesnt prescribe it so as far as im concerned that was a waste of my time i told her i didnt want any othee medications she was so insistent that i finally just let her prescribe something for me but i never picked it up kind of a waste of time she also told me the medication she did prescribe me only had a side effect of being drowsy when i looked it up online the side effects were worse than my actual problems and would have been a nightmare if i actually took it;3;Negative

Tori Cason;May 30, 2022;this company preys upon people who are trying to improve their mental health i was excited to start therapy and do it from the comfort of my home i signed up in dec 2021 and had one therapy session which was solely centered around medications not about me i decided to give it a month and try it out i didnt notice any difference being on the medications but you have to make an appointment each month to keep up with the meds and i thought maybe it takes time to work so when i went to make an appointment for the next month there was no availability so not only was i paying 85 for the month and not getting the service i also couldnt continue the medication i decided it was time to cancel but there is nowhere on the app or website to cancel i tried to call and all you can get is a machine i couldnt talk to anyone i finally found that you have to email them to cancel your subscription which i did and never received a reply they of course continued to charge me for 5 months and i never would get a reply when emailing them i finally cancelled my debit card to try to get them to stop charging me which still didnt work i finally emailed them again telling them that i had reported them to the better business bureau and that i would be contacting an attorney next if they still refuse to cancel my subscription they emailed me back 10 minutes later on a sunday at 7p on memorial day weekend if they are responding to me on a holiday weekend they obviously read my previous emails to cancel and chose to ignore them this is disgusting i feel taken advantage of by trying to improve my mental health and better myself this has been such a hassle and i couldnt believe a company could be this awful i wouldnt recommend this company to anyone ever;1;Negative

JA;March 01, 2024;just to echo other comments here the app is fine and the results arent really ground breaking basically eat minimal processed food and more plants and youve completed zoe without the need to spend 300 on a test kit the reason for such a low rating is the fact that they trick you into paying for at least 4 months membership for an app that really requires you to only use it for 23 weeks at most they also have not managed to figure out that people exercise and need to increase their protein and calorie intake so if you do a work out and take a protein shake be prepared for the app to penalise you undermining all the other hard work youve done and if they try to justify the cost with their on hand expert nutritionists their answers typically follow the lines of listen to your body so again not really ground breaking tldr save yourself several hundreds of pounds and just eat less processed food in response to the reply from zoeyou used my name in your reply despite me not telling you it and only giving you my email but somehow you cant find my account was that just an attempt to discredited my genuine review;1;Negative

Michael Clancey;April 21, 2024;wish i would have read the reviews before i did the trial legit companies give you a heads up before tapping your account again i saw no value from the service but apparently that is not a valid reason for refund no personal or financial reasons which pretty much encompasses anything another 100 lesson they actually did refund me which was a surprise;1;Negative
customer;September 08, 2023;the whole membership and app itself is all a gimmick and a bit of a scam regardless of how high you score i scored 92100 for blood sugar response breadspastastarches and anything sugary is always scored poorly even though i have an extremely good sugar response it seems like its not personalised at all it even says tomatoes rank badly because of the sugar content  3g sugar per 80g tomatoes to be scored badly is outrageously wrong;1;Negative

Dr SSM;February 15, 2024;i joined zoe after almost a year of cleaning up my diet with the hope of fine tuning my nutrition it was a lot of money to join zoe but now i feel that it was worth everything i spent on it i have to admit that i did not like the cookies test because the taste was so sweet however the blood test and gut test were straight forward the results came back quickly and were extremely detailed it gave me a huge insight about my gut health i got my individual scores and then the meal planning started i realised how my zoe scores helped implement effective meal planning and therefore were giving me very healthy cgm traces the support by staff and nutritionists was fantastic recently i had some questions about calcium intake and holly was able to provide with some great resources furthermore she answered other queries about tips of fasting in ramadhan and lists of foods that were rich in certain electrolytes she made me feel comfortable at asking questions that is exactly how client support should be thank you holly all the staff have been and were extremely patient with my detailed and complicated questions with every question and their help i felt more enlightened my knowledge developed by the extremely thorough daily lessons on the app and the recipe ideas podcasts material from zoe staff on studies etc there is a lot of information which i absolutely loved it was easy to grasp more so the zoe podcast and interviews with the zoe scientists have been exceptionally intriguing i am learning so much i am applying the knowledge to my family too in fact i am now encouraging my husband to join zoe i think the zoe program is the breakthrough we needed its the best program by far its so thorough its the detail we needed its the lateral thinking we needed its the approach where we needed to put the pieces of puzzles together rather than a single ideation which so many programs have furthermore most programs are too restrictive zoe ticks all the boxes in this program its common sense and a lot of logic behind planning meals that are diverse a crucial step for our microbiome its backed up by their hard work and so many fantastic studies thank you zoe thank you to your amazing scientists like professor tim spector;5;Positive

Jessica Reynoso;February 17, 2021;my prescription recently expired and i could not get an appointment scheduled until a month or so out at planned parenthood where i usually go so i decided to give alpha medical a try they are quick and respond to all your questions they were able to give me my same prescription just 5 more expensive which is fine for the convenience of not having to drive to pp every month i just had to get a blood pressure screening at walgreens for them to be able to give me my same prescription i highly recommend alpha medical and will be using them going forward;5;Positive
G;December 31, 2023;i love the idea of zoe but after less than a year of using it its clear that its fundamentally flawed as a health tooli did my test and it recommended eating things like cashews and full fat yoghurt however now i have just been diagnosed with dangerously high cholesterol leading to increased risk of strokewhat i loved about the zoe idea is that it would help me plan balanced meals and a diet based on my biology but its clear that over the medium and long term the plan and advice is not fit for purpose;1;Negative

Poppy;February 10, 2024;to start with the positives the programme worked technically well app tests i didnt have any issues there was support available when i had questions they were answered quicklyunfortunately i didnt learn much new from the programme i didnt get much out of wearing the blood sugar monitor the results are not that easy to interpret if youre not an expert and as the readings are in a different app then where you log your meals and you cant log exercise at all its quite difficult to draw any conclusionsthe advice on meals i got based on my test results was basically what i already knew about healthy eating i didnt find the lessons that useful they didnt contain that much information and were sometimes a bit patronising logging meals is a lot of effort the app could be improved and it shows your daily calorie intake which is not helpful if youre trying to move away from a calorie based dietso all in all the programme is ok and maybe useful if you have a fairly unhealthy diet and try to overhaul it or if you find out something surprising from the tests but i expected a bit more for the price;3;Neutral
